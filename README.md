## 🏁 Getting started
### 🐍 Installing Python 3
You will need Python 3 in order to run the application. You can see how to install it [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
Once Python 3 is installed, you can follow the next steps to create a virtual enviroment and install the dependencies in it.

### 🌱 Creating virtual enviroment and installing dependencies
To create the virtual enviroment, run:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
To activate the virtual enviroment in a shell enviroment, run:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
To deactivate the virtual enviroment, you can simply run the command `deactivate`.

To install the dependencies in virtual enviroment, run:
```
python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Testing
To execute all tests, in virtual enviroment run:
```
python3 -m pytest
```
If some issue occurs, you can alternatively run `python3 -m pytest -s -vv`.

To execute one specifict test file, you can run the command with the file path. Example:
```
python3 -m pytest tests/sorting/test_sorting.py
```
To execute one specific test function, you can run the command with the flag `-k` and the function. Example:
```
python3 -m pytest -k test_sort_by_criteria
```
